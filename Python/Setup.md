# Setup
## Requirements
When setting up your MFT-API using Python, we recommend the 'Requests' module is used.
This can be easily installed using pip, using the following command:

`pip install requests`

If this command is 'not found' then attempt to locate your python environment and navigate to the 'Scripts' directory. The default Scripts location for python 3.6 onwards is as follows, depending on your operating system.
#### Windows:
`C:\Users\<user>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python<version>\Scripts`
#### Linux / MacOS:
`/usr/bin/python/Scripts`
When inside the directory run the following command that corresponds to your operating system:
`pip.exe install requests`
OR
`./pip.exe install requests`

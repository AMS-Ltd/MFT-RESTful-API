# MFT-RESTful-API
The AMS MFT Web Services provides developers with the ability to integrate secure messaging capability into an existing application or website, and to build new applications that incorporate secure-messaging functionality with an easy-to-use Restful API. 

REST API provides a powerful, convenient, and simple Web services API for interacting with MFT. Its advantages include ease of integration and development, and itâ€™s an excellent choice of technology for use with mobile applications and Web 2.0 projects. All requests to the API must be made via HTTPS.
